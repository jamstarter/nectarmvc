<h1>Helpers, Variables & Views</h1>
<h2>Accessing Global Variables / Helpers From a Controller</h2>
You can access $_POST and $_GET variables as well as some other helpful variables from within a controller using the following:
<xmp class='cli'>$post = $this->_post;     // Get $_POST variables
$get = $this->_get;       // Get $_GET variables
$params = $this->_params; // Get a combo of $_POST and $_GET
$config = $this->_config; // Get application config for the current environment
</xmp>
<br>
<h2>Global Constants</h2>
In addition to global variables, there are some constants defined by Nectar that you can use throughout your application.<br>
<xmp class='cli'>echo APPLICATION_PATH;    //outputs the full path to the Nectar installation ie. /var/www/nectar
echo APPLICATION_ENV;     //outputs the environment name ie. production, staging, development, etc</xmp>
<br>
<h2>Sending Data to the View</h2>
You can send data to a view by using $this->view from the controller method corresponding to your view.
<xmp class='cli'>$this->view->myVar = "Hello";
$this->view->user = $usersModel->getById(35);</xmp>
<br>
In the view twig file, you can use that variable like this:
<xmp class='cli'>{% verbatim %}{{myVar}}         //outputs "Hello"
{{user.email}}    //outputs "james@bond.com" {% endverbatim %}</xmp>

<br>


<h2>Disabling the Layout</h2>
You may need to disabled your layout if you want to send AJAX requests to a controller. You can disable your layout for a specific action in a controller like this:<br>
<xmp class='cli'><?php

class IndexController extends Controller{


  function index(){
      $this->_layout = 'none';
  }
}</xmp>
